/*
 * State manager is a state machine which works as follows:
 *    +-----------+       +------------+
 *    |  Initial  |------>|  Disabled  |
 *    +-----------+       +------------+
 *           |
 *           | StateManager.loadState() is called,
 *           | StateManager will call chrome.storage.local.get()
 *           |
 *           v
 *    +-----------+
 *    |  Loading  |
 *    +-----------+
 *           |
 *           | chrome.storage.local.get() callback is called,
 *           | StateManager has loaded the data.
 *           |
 *           v
 *     +----------+
 *     |  Ready   |<---------------------------------+
 *     +----------+                                  |
 *           |                                       |
 *           | StateManager.saveState() is called,   |
 *           | StateManager will callect data and    |
 *           | call chrome.storage.local.set()       |
 *           v                                       |
 *    +-----------+----------------------------------+
 *    |  Saving   |
 *    +-----------+<---------------------------------+
 *           |                                       |
 *           | StateManager.saveState() is called    |
 *           | before ongoing write operation ends.  |
 *           |                                       |
 *           v                                       |
 *    +-----------------+                            |
 *    | Saving Override |----------------------------+
 *    +-----------------+
 *
 * Initial - Only constructor was called.
 * Disabled - current build and/or platform uses persistent background.
 *   Storage anager is disabled (is a NOOP).
 * Loading - loadState() is called
 * Ready - data was retreived from storage.
 * Saving - saveState() is called and there is no chrome.storage.local.set()
 *   operation in progress. We just need to collect and save the data.
 * Saving Override - saveState() is called before the last write operation
 *   was complete (data became obsolete even before it was written to storage).
 *   We wait for ongoing write operation to end and only then start a new one.
