/*
 * This class synchronizes some JS object's attributes and data stored in
 * chrome.storage.local, with minimal delay. It follows these principles:
 *  - no debouncing, data is saved as soon as saveState() is called
 *  - no concurrent writes (calls to s.c.l.set()): if saveState() is called
 *    repeatedly before previous call is complete, this class will wait for
 *    active write to complete and will save new data.
 *  - no concurrent reads (calls to s.c.l.get()): if loadState() is called
 *    repeatedly before previous call is complete, this class will wait for
 *    active read to complete and will resolve all loadState() calls at once.
 *  - all simultaniously active calls to saveState() and loadState() wait for
 *    data to settle and resolve only after data is guaranteed to be coherent.
 *  - data saved with the browser always wins (because JS typically has only
 *    default values and to ensure that if the same class exists in multiple
 *    contexts every instance of this class has the same values)
 * In practice, these principles imply that at any given moment there is either
 * no active read and write operations or this class is performing exactly one
 * read or exactly one write operation.
 *
 * State manager is a state machine which works as follows:

 *
 * R and W indicate active read (get) and write (set) operations.
 *
 * Initial - Only constructor was called.
 * Loading - loadState() is called
 * Ready - data was retreived from storage.
 * Saving - saveState() is called and there is no chrome.storage.local.set()
 *   operation in progress. We just need to collect and save the data.
 * Saving Override - saveState() is called before the last write operation
 *   was complete (data became obsolete even before it was written to storage).
 *   We wait for ongoing write operation to end and only then start a new one.
 * OnChange Race - chrome.storage.onChanged listener was called during an active
 *   read/write operation. StateManager needs to wait for that operation to end
 *   and re-request data again.
 * Recovery - state manager detected a race condition, probably caused by an
 *   onChanged event during data loading or saving. State Manager will load data
 *   from browser to ensure data coherence.
