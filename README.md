## Why it matters

- Less visual noise means sharper focus and lower cognitive load in low‑light environments.
- Faster, lighter theming improves responsiveness across tabs and keeps battery drain in check on laptops.
- Clear defaults reduce setup time; most users get an ideal dark mode without digging into settings.

## Key features

- Smart dark mode that respects content, avoids harsh inversion, and favors readable contrast.
- Instant toggle, per‑site apply/skip, and whitelist/blacklist controls for effortless behavior tuning.
- Compact settings with brightness, contrast, and sepia/warmth controls for comfort over long reads.
- Open and developer‑friendly build flow with standard tooling and simple configuration flags.

## Positioning statement

Lean Dark+ is the minimalist dark mode extension that delivers clean, accurate theming with near‑zero clutter for focused readers, developers, and night‑owls—unlike heavy, option‑dense alternatives that slow the browsing experience.
