<p align="center">Dark Reader is an <strong>open-source</strong> MIT-licensed <strong>browser extension</strong> designed to analyze web pages. Dark Reader will generate a dark mode that aims to <strong>reduce the eyestrain</strong> of the user.

## Questions

Most questions can be answered by reading the [help page](https://darkreader.org/help/).
If the help page doesn't answer your question, open up a new [discussion](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader/discussions).

## How to contribute

Read more about contributing to Dark Reader in [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Building for use

Dark Reader build script requires a JavaScript runtime, either NodeJS or Deno. We recommend using NodeJS, Deno support is experimental.

### Building with NodeJS

You can install the extension from a file.
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (we recommend LTS or higher, but any version at or above 15 will work). Download the source code (or check out from git).
Open the terminal in the root folder and run:

- `npm install`
- `npm run build` or `npm run build [-- flags]`

This will create a `build/release/darkreader-chrome.zip` file for use in a Chromium-based browser and a `build/release/darkreader-firefox.xpi` file for use in Firefox.

You can customize build process by passing flags to build script. To see all flags, run `npm run build -- --help`.

### Building with Deno

You can build Dark Reader with alternative runtime called [Deno](https://deno.land/). For this run `deno:bootstrap` script (e.g., via `npm run deno:bootstrap` or manually copy the command from `package.json`). Then run the same commands described above.

Please note that if you encounter error `Too many open files (os error 24)`, then you should use the newer version of Deno (preferably built from source or canary).

### Bundling with official Firefox store signatures (experimental)

Prior to publication, extension stores provide digital signatures for extensions. These digital signatures certify the integrity of the archive (that extension bundle did not get corrupted or bit-rotted) and that extension store performed very basic extension validation.

Dark Reader repository contains these digital signatures and you can add them to the extension bundle. The following will build Dark Reader for Firefox version 4.9.63:
```
npm run build -- --firefox --version=4.9.63
```

Please note that only Firefox Add-ons store signatures are present in the repository right now. Also, due to NodeJS and TypeScript version compatibility, one might have to first check out the old revision (commit), then build the extension files, then check out the recent commit and create the bundle (by running only `signature` and `zip` steps).

## Using Dark Reader on a website

You can use Dark Reader to enable dark mode on your website!

- Install the package from NPM (`npm install darkreader`)
- or build from the source code (`npm run api`)
- or include the script via a CDN such as [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/darkreader/) or [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/darkreader)

Then you can use the following code to control Dark Reader's API:
```javascript
DarkReader.enable({
    brightness: 100,
    contrast: 90,
    sepia: 10
});

DarkReader.disable();

// Enable when the system color scheme is dark.
DarkReader.auto({
    brightness: 100,
    contrast: 90,
    sepia: 10
});

// Stop watching for the system color scheme.
DarkReader.auto(false);

// Get the generated CSS of Dark Reader returned as a string.
const CSS = await DarkReader.exportGeneratedCSS();

// Check if Dark Reader is enabled.
const isEnabled = DarkReader.isEnabled();
```

... or if you are using ES modules:

```javascript
import {
    enable as enableDarkMode,
    disable as disableDarkMode,
    auto as followSystemColorScheme,
    exportGeneratedCSS as collectCSS,
    isEnabled as isDarkReaderEnabled
} from 'darkreader';

enableDarkMode({
    brightness: 100,
    contrast: 90,
    sepia: 10,
});

disableDarkMode();

followSystemColorScheme();

const CSS = await collectCSS();

const isEnabled = isDarkReaderEnabled();
```

Be aware that Dark Reader will add the `chrome` object onto the `window` object. These are to stub certain functions that the code will use. They originate from the webextension-api.

## Site fixes

Automatically syncing the site fixes for every Dark Reader user was disabled because the GitHub team does not allow using GitHub as a content delivery network (CDN). The storage of these files would be expensive, and making requests to other resources would look suspicious. Each new release of Dark Reader will include the new changes.

However, this can be manually enabled with the following steps:

1. Click on the Dark Reader extension icon.
2. Click on the `Dev tools` button (in the bottom-right corner).
3. Go to `Advanced` and click on the `Preview new design` button.
4. Close the developer tools window and click on the Dark Reader extension icon again.
5. Go to `Settings` -> `Advanced` and enable the `Synchronize sites fixes` setting.

To force a synchronization of the sites fixes (when the corresponding setting is enabled), perform the following steps:

1. Click on the Dark Reader extension icon.
2. Go to `Settings` -> `Advanced` -> `Dev tools`.
3. For each "Editor" section, click on `Reset changes`, confirm with `OK`, and then click on `Apply`. Afterwards, close the developer tools window and reload the desired page(s).

## Enable Dark Reader on restricted pages on Mozilla Firefox

By default, Dark Reader does not work on some websites due to **security restrictions** enforced by Mozilla.

The following instructions will guide you on how to disable those restrictions.

**Proceed with caution. This exposes you to a security risk if you do not know what you are doing.**

**Be sure that you do not have any suspicious or malicious-looking extension installed before proceeding.**

**These settings will apply to all extensions, and not just Dark Reader.**

Step 1: change Dark Reader's settings.

1. Click on the Dark Reader extension icon.
2. Click on the `Dev tools` button (in the bottom-right corner).
3. Go to `Advanced` and click on the `Preview new design` button.
4. Close the developer tools window and click on the Dark Reader extension icon again.
5. Go to `Settings` -> `Advanced` and enable the `Enable on restricted pages` setting.

Step 2: change Firefox's settings.

- Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter.
  - A warning page may appear. Click `Accept the Risk and Continue` to proceed.
- Search for and set `extensions.webextensions.restrictedDomains` to an empty value (if the preference does not exist, create with it `String` as the type).
- Set `privacy.resistFingerprinting.block_mozAddonManager` to `true` (if the preference does not exist, create with it `Boolean` as the type).

After changing the necessary settings for both Dark Reader and Firefox, reload the desired page(s).

**If you had previously changed any of the following preferences, please reset them to their default values as they are only related to security and are not necessary for Dark Reader to work on restricted websites.**
To reset them, click on the reset (or delete icon, if present) icon at the most-right corner of the preference line in `about:config`.
- `extensions.webextensions.addons-restricted-domains@mozilla.com.disabled`
- `extensions.quarantinedDomains.enabled`
- `extensions.quarantinedDomains.list`

### Clarification about quarantined domains ("Run on sites with restrictions" option)
<details><summary>Quarantined domains and Dark Reader â€” an explanation</summary>

The option "Run on sites with restrictions", present in some extensions, is only related to quarantined domains, and is not needed for Dark Reader to work on restricted websites.

More information about quarantined domains: [Why are some add-ons not allowed on sites restricted by Mozilla?](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/quarantined-domains)

For Dark Reader, the option is not shown because Dark Reader is a [Recommended](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/recommended-extensions-program) extension by Mozilla.

Due to it being a Recommended extension, it means it meets the "highest standards of security, functionality, and user experience". The quarantined domains are only related to security, and because Dark Reader is considered secure by Mozilla, that option is not shown, meaning **it will always run even on quarantined domains**.

[From Firefox's source code:](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/toolkit/components/extensions/Extension.sys.mjs#2937-2938)

```
// Privileged extensions and any extensions with a recommendation state are
// exempt from the quarantined domains.
```
