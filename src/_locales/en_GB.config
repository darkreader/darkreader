@store_listing
This eye-care extension enables night mode creating dark themes for websites on the fly. Dark Reader inverts bright colours making them high contrast and easy to read at night.

You can adjust brightness, contrast, sepia filter, dark mode, font settings and ignore-list.

Dark Reader doesn't show ads and doesn't send user's data anywhere. It is fully open-source https://github.com/darkreader/darkreader

Before you install disable similar extensions. Enjoy watching!
