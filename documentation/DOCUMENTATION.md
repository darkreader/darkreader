# Usage

### Main Page

![Main Page](/documentation/main_panel.png)

The three choices at the top can be used to turn the entire extension on or off or set it to automatic mode.  Automatic mode uses the system dark theme to choose if the extension should be enabled or not.

The button with the website name enables or disables the extension for the current site.  This button will be disabled for if the extension cannot be used on this page.  The default for this can be set in the settings page.

![Theme Select](/documentation/theme_select.png)

The theme drop down can be used to create or select a theme for the current website:

* **Theme for all websites** changing this theme affects all websites that do not have another theme set.
* **Theme for \<site name\>** changes to this theme only affect the current site.
* **Create new theme** creates a new theme that can be assigned to different websites.  To delete the theme select another theme option must be selected and then the theme can be deleted from the drop down.

The theme type can be switched between dark and light and the brightness and contrast can be adjusted to your preference.

The theme generation mode drop down can be used to change how the theme is generated:
 
* **Dynamic** deeply analyzes website stylesheets, background images, and vector graphics. Requires some resources on initial page load, but produces the best visual results.
* **Filter** inverts the whole page and reverts some parts back. Requires GPU resources. It is fast and powerful, but has several issues: it disables text sub-pixel rendering, inverts already dark parts into light, causes lags on large pages, and fails to render some pages in Firefox.
* **Filter+** is the same as Filter, but is based on custom SVG filters and handles colors better making images less dull. Works poorly in Firefox.
* **Static** rapidly generates a basic stylesheet.

#### Theme Options

![Theme Options](/documentation/theme_options.png)

Sepia and grayscale (saturation) can be adjusted here.  The colors and fonts buttons further allow modifying the theme.  The values for the theme can be reset to their defaults using the button at the bottom.

#### Colors

![Theme Colors](/documentation/theme_colors.png)

The background, text, scrollbar, and selected text colors can be modified here.

#### Fonts & More

![Fonts & More](/documentation/theme_fonts.png)

The extension can change the websiteâ€™s font here if selected.  Increasing the text stroke makes text on the page appear more bold.
