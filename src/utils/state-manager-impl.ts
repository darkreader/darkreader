/*
 * This class synchronizes some JS object's attributes and data stored in
 * chrome.storage.local, with minimal delay. It follows these principles:
 *  - no debouncing, data is saved as soon as saveState() is called
 *  - no concurrent writes (calls to s.c.l.set()): if saveState() is called
 *    repeatedly before previous call is complete, this class will wait for
 *    active write to complete and will save new data.
 *  - no concurrent reads (calls to s.c.l.get()): if loadState() is called
 *    repeatedly before previous call is complete, this class will wait for
 *    active read to complete and will resolve all loadState() calls at once.
 *  - all simultaniously active calls to saveState() and loadState() wait for
 *    data to settle and resolve only after data is guaranteed to be coherent.
 *  - data saved with the browser always wins (because JS typically has only
 *    default values and to ensure that if the same class exists in multiple
 *    contexts every instance of this class has the same values)
 *
 * State manager is a state machine which works as follows:
 *    +-----------+
 *    |  Initial  |
 *    +-----------+
 *           |
 *           | StateManagerImpl.loadState() is called,
 *           | StateManagerImpl will call chrome.storage.local.get()
 *           |
 *           v
 *    +-----------+
 *    |  Loading  |
 *    +-----------+
 *           |
 *           | chrome.storage.local.get() callback is called,
 *           | StateManagerImpl has loaded the data.
 *           |
 *           v
 *     +----------+
 *     |  Ready   |<-------------------------------------+
 *     +----------+                                      |
 *           |                                           |
 *           | StateManagerImpl.saveState() is called,   |
 *           | StateManagerImpl will callect data and    |
 *           | call chrome.storage.local.set()           |
 *           v                                           |
 *    +-----------+--------------------------------------+
 *    |  Saving   |
 *    +-----------+<-------------------------------------+
 *           |                                           |
 *           | StateManagerImpl.saveState() is called    |
 *           | before ongoing write operation ends.      |
 *           |                                           |
 *           v                                           |
 *    +-----------------+                                |
 *    | Saving Override |--------------------------------+
 *    +-----------------+
 *
 * Initial - Only constructor was called.
 * Loading - loadState() is called
 * Ready - data was retreived from storage.
 * Saving - saveState() is called and there is no chrome.storage.local.set()
 *   operation in progress. We just need to collect and save the data.
 * Saving Override - saveState() is called before the last write operation
 *   was complete (data became obsolete even before it was written to storage).
 *   We wait for ongoing write operation to end and only then start a new one.
